## Prompt Template

```text
You are a senior product designer reviewing the Riposte app — a meme organizer
built for speed. The core experience: chatting → need a meme → open app → find
via emoji/search → share → back to chat in under 10 seconds.

Think like a REAL USER in a hurry, not a developer or designer with a ruler.
This is a meme app — it should feel fun and fast, not sterile and corporate.

Screenshot path: [SCREENSHOT_PATH]
Use the `view` tool to load and examine the screenshot before proceeding.

Screen: [SCREEN_NAME] — State: [STATE]

EVALUATE AGAINST THESE DIMENSIONS:

1. FIRST IMPRESSION (gut check)
   - What's your instant reaction? Polished, unfinished, or somewhere between?
   - Does it feel like a crafted product or a developer prototype?
   - What's the first thing your eye is drawn to? Is that the right thing?
   - Does it feel appropriate for a meme app (fun, playful, not overly serious)?

2. INFORMATION HIERARCHY
   - Is the most important content the most prominent?
   - Can you tell what actions are available without hunting?
   - Is the screen's purpose immediately clear?
   - Is there visual noise competing for attention?

3. USER TASK EFFICIENCY
   - How many taps to achieve this screen's primary goal?
   - Is there friction that shouldn't be there?
   - Are common actions in the thumb zone (bottom half of screen)?
   - Could a user complete the task here in under 3 seconds?

4. VISUAL DENSITY & BREATHING ROOM
   - Does the screen feel cramped or spacious?
   - Is content density appropriate for quick scanning?
   - Do elements breathe without wasting space?
   - Would this work when the user is multitasking (glancing, not studying)?

5. EMOTIONAL QUALITY
   - Does the app feel fun and delightful?
   - Does the color palette feel harmonious?
   - Do emoji elements feel integrated into the design or bolted on?
   - Would you WANT to use this app, or is it merely functional?

6. PLATFORM CONVENTIONS
   - Does it feel like a native Android app?
   - Are Material 3 patterns recognizable?
   - Does the status/navigation bar integrate naturally?
   - Are gestures and navigation patterns familiar?

7. CONTENT RESILIENCE
   - What if a meme has no tags, no description?
   - What about very long descriptions or many tags?
   - Is the empty state helpful or depressing?
   - Does the screen handle 1 item and 1000 items gracefully?

OUTPUT FORMAT — for each issue found:
- SCREEN AREA: General location
- SEVERITY: 🔴 Breaks trust / 🟡 Feels unpolished / 🔵 Perfectionist nitpick
- EVIDENCE: What specifically triggered this observation
- CONFIDENCE: High / Medium / Low
- USER IMPACT: How this affects a real user doing "find meme → share"
- SUGGESTION: What would make it better (be specific)

Also note 2-3 things that genuinely delight or work well on this screen.
Don't manufacture positives — only note what's authentically good.

## When to Use

- **Always** on critical path screens (Gallery, Detail, Share)
- On other screens when doing a full audit
- **Skip** for verification re-screenshots (use quick verify instead)

## Context to Include

When possible, tell the model what screen came before and after in the user flow:

```text
FLOW CONTEXT:
- Previous screen: [name]
- User's goal: [what they're trying to do]
- Next expected screen: [name]
```
