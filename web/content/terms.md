## Agreement

By downloading, installing, or using Riposte ("the App"), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## License

Riposte is free software distributed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/adsamcik/meme-my-mood/blob/main/LICENSE). You are free to use, modify, and redistribute the App in accordance with that license.

## No Warranty

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. The full disclaimer is provided in sections 15–17 of the GPL v3.0 license. In summary:

- The App may contain bugs or errors
- There is no guarantee of fitness for any particular purpose
- The developers are not liable for any damages arising from use of the App

## Your Responsibilities

- **Content ownership**: You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to use and share any images you import into the App.
- **Legal compliance**: You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
- **Backups**: The App stores data locally on your device. You are responsible for backing up your data.

## On-Device AI

The App uses on-device machine learning to analyze images for features like text extraction and emoji suggestions. These AI-generated results are automated and may not always be accurate. You should review and adjust tags and descriptions as needed.

## Third-Party Services

The App itself does not connect to third-party services. However, when you use the Android share function, your content is shared with the app you select — that app's own terms and privacy policy apply.

## Changes to These Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Contact

For questions about these terms, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adsamcik/meme-my-mood/issues).
